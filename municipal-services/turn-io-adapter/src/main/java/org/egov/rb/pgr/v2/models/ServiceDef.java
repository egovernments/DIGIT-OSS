If this is null then it is assumed taht service does not have any metadata, else the metadata is defined in the OpenAPI definition. This allows for a well structured powerful metadata definition.  2. Due to this ServiceRequest object has been enhanced to include metadata values (aka attribute value in Open311) as an JSON object.
