        description: |
            Fund is a defining concept in municipal accounting – where it is required to
            segregate all accounting transactions into designated funds. Each fund needs
            to be treated as an independent accounting entity – in other words, all
            vouchers within a fund must be self-balancing and balance sheets and
            IncomeExpenditure reports must be generated for each fund. A hierarchy of
            funds may be defined – i.e. each fund can have multiple sub-funds and so on.

          id:

            description: |
              identifier appears as prefix in all the vouchers accounted in the books
              of the Fund. Each fund must have an identifier – each voucher belonging
              to a fund must have the identifier embedded in the voucher number for
              easy identification. Fund is taken at a voucher head level for each
              voucher transaction.

              under the Fund.
